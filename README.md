# Hey! ðŸ‘‹
 I'm Suraj, a student interested in web design, audio, immersive storytelling and other stuff. I'm a fan of atmospheric websites, non-utility, web poetics, and anything pretentious. If I played more games, I'd probably be into that too. Also, I learned how to use GitHub 30 seconds ago, so this is exciting!

## Some of my favorite sites:
* *[Making a Poetic Web(site)](https://chiaski.github.io/poeticweb/)*
* *[Digitization Wiki](https://www.digitization.wiki)*
* *[The Sound of Love](https://thesoundof.love)*
* *[Rivers](https://whykatherine.github.io/rivers/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)*
* *[Bubbles](https://oimo.io/works/bubbles/)*
* *[An App Can be a Homecooked Meal](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/)*

## Others worth checking out (the archive):
* *[Childishism](https://childishism.com/?q=pious)*
* *[Jerobeam Fenderson's Oscilloscope Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaGwJ5VJtYo)*
* *[Sunday Sites](https://sundaysites.cafe/index.html)*
